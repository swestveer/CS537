The executable 537make is a simple version of linux make.
The program contains four big modules. 

The main file checks for the flag -f 

1. text_parsing
-process either a specified makefile using -f or Makefile and if that is not found, makefile
-prints to stderr if a line is not a comment, valid target or a valid command.
-If variables are present it replaces variables in makefile.
-Passes a processed array back to main for further processing.

2. build_spec_graph
- build a tree structure where each node is a file specified in the makefile
- check for duplicate targets
- traverse to check for cycles

3. build_spec_repr
- traverse through the graph 
- check for modification time 
- check if files exist
- return a list of targets that needs to be recompiled

4. proc_creation_prog_exe
- execute the commands of the list of targets by forking and execvp

5. node.h
- contains definition of the nodes in the tree
